Before starting the PWK course I solved little over a dozen of the Vulnhub VMs, mainly so I don’t need to start from rock bottom on the PWK lab. Below is a list of machines I rooted, most of them are similar to what you’ll be facing in the lab. I’ve written walkthroughs for a few of them as well, but try harder first ;)
